# PPE-object-detection

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements an intelligent PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) Detection System using the YOLOv8 object detection model. The goal is to automatically identify the presence or absence of essential safety gear such as helmets, vests, and face masks on personnel in real-time. The system is trained on a custom dataset and can be used for real-world safety monitoring in construction, industrial, and hazardous work environments.

âœ¨ Key Features
âœ… Real-time detection of safety helmets, vests, and face masks

ðŸŽ¯ Trained using YOLOv8 with high accuracy and speed

ðŸ§  Custom dataset used to fine-tune model performance

ðŸ“¸ Supports webcam, image, and video-based input

ðŸ“Š Generates performance metrics (mAP, precision, recall)

ðŸ’¡ Easy to deploy in surveillance or safety compliance applications
